# Song Player App
A basic song player application with a visually appealing UI, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app plays songs stored locally.

## How to use:
![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acb8a6f8-02da-460f-9bf4-91990269ce8a)
This is the home screen. By default, the list on the left side displays all of the songs. The list on the right displays songs in a playlist. By default the app makes a playlist named 'favourites' which includes one song from each genre.

![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37e8e90f-d714-4485-ad41-d45c07af266b)
In the left list, the songs can be filtered according to their genre by choosing a genre from the dropdown. The list will update itself according to the genre selected.

The song can be played simply by clicking on it form either of the playlists (left or right). At the bottom of the middle section the buttons display options for pausing / playing the song, the playback progress bar and the next and previous song buttons. By clicking on the next / previous buttons, the next / previous song from the current playlist starts playing.

A new playlist can be made using the input field and the button at the bottom right corner of the left section. Enter the name of your new playlist and press the button (having '+' sign). This will create a new empty playlist. To add songs to this playlist, select a song from the left playlist and then click on the 'add to current playlist' button at the bottom of the middle section. This will add the song to the playlist selected on the right section.

A playlist can be selected from the dropdown at the top of the right div. To remove a song from a playlist, simply click the cross (or 'x') sign present after the song's name in the list.

The color theme of the app can be changed from light to dark and vice versa by clicking the slider button at the top right corner of the page.

## Additional Considerations
-- A playlist without a name cannot be created
-- The same song cannot be added twice in a playlist.

## Built from scratch using
